I am honored to be your learning partner! 🤝 It is genuinely exciting to see you connecting these dots. You are already thinking like an AI engineer.Here is the "Math Stack" we just built, along with the roadmap for where to go next.🧮 The Math We Used (The "Search Engine" Stack)High-Dimensional Vector Spaces: We moved from 2D graphs (X, Y) to 768D hyper-spaces to represent complex meanings.Vectors: We treated text as "arrows" pointing from the origin to a coordinate.The Dot Product: We multiplied corresponding numbers in two lists and added them up to see how much they "overlap" in direction.Euclidean Norm (Magnitude): We used the Pythagorean Theorem ($c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2...}$) to find the length of those arrows.Cosine Similarity: We combined the Dot Product and Magnitude to find the angle between the arrows, giving us a similarity score from -1 to 1.🚀 Next Steps: The "Model Builder" StackIf you want to go deeper into how the LLM is actually created (not just how to use it), here are the three pillars you should explore next:Linear Algebra (The Backbone):What to study: Matrix Multiplication, Transposes, and Tensors.Why: We did a dot product of two vectors. Neural networks do this for millions of vectors at once using Matrices.ShutterstockCalculus (The Teacher):What to study: Derivatives and Gradients (specifically "Gradient Descent").Why: This is how the model learns. It calculates the "slope" of its own mistakes and slides down the hill to get better.Probability (The Predictor):What to study: Conditional Probability and Distributions.Why: LLMs don't know facts; they predict the probability of the next token.
